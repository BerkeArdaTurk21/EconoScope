## 🎯 Project Overview

This project analyses the **Global Inflation Dataset** sourced from the IMF and World Bank, covering 212 countries across five decades. The dataset includes five inflation types: Headline CPI, Food CPI, Energy CPI, Core CPI and Producer Price Inflation.

The analysis focuses on:
- Long-term global inflation trends
- Country-level comparisons across major economies
- Identifying the highest-inflation countries in recent years
- Comparing headline, food and energy inflation
- Decade-by-decade heatmap for selected countries

---

## 📊 Key Questions Answered

- How has global average inflation changed since 1970?
- Which countries had the highest inflation in 2022?
- How do major economies like the US, Germany, Turkey and Brazil compare?
- Is food or energy inflation higher than headline CPI?
- Which decades were the most inflationary?
